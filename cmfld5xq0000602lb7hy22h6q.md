## Introduction

I’m Rushikesh, a Computer Science graduate from a Tier-3 college. Like many aspiring engineers, I once dreamed of making it big at the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). But here’s the truth, my journey didn’t begin with victory or recognition; it began on the sidelines, watching others win while I learned what it really takes to get there. Back in my 2nd year, something remarkable happened on our campus our seniors won the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2022**. Their energy was electric. The way they spoke about their **36-hour grind**, **sleepless nights**, and the thrill of solving a real-world problem in front of industry experts left us both astonished and inspired.

That day, my friends and I who proudly called ourselves the ***Coding Saints*,** made a pact

> ***“ If they can do it, why can’t we? ”***

So, if you’re excited about SIH 2025 and want some real student-to-student advice, keep scrolling. Trust me, this story is as much a guide for you as it is my personal journey. 🚀

## Understanding SIH: The Father of All Hackathons 👨‍💻🏆

When most people hear the word *hackathon*, they picture a bunch of students coding overnight, surviving on coffee and adrenaline, to solve some random problem statement. But **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** is in a league of its own. It’s not *just* a hackathon, it’s often called the **“Father of all Hackathons”** because of its massive scale, real-world impact, and the way it pushes students beyond their limits.

Every year, SIH brings together:

* **200+ problem statements (PS)** straight from ministries, industries, and NGOs.
    
* **20+ government and private organizations** putting forward real challenges that actually matter.
    
* The backing of the **Government of India**, which makes the event both prestigious and impactful.
    

SIH is not a one-night coding sprint. It’s a **3-stage marathon** that tests your **Idea, Execution and Endurance.**

### 1\. Internal Hackathon: The First Filter 🎯

This is where it all begins. Every college organizes its own internal hackathon to **shortlist the best teams**. The rules may differ from campus to campus, but typically:

* You **pitch your idea** to the jury.
    
* The college **SPOC (Single Point of Contact)** nominates the **top 35 teams**.
    
* These selected teams then get the **green signal** to officially submit their solution on the SIH portal.
    

Don’t take this phase lightly. Many teams fail because they don’t treat the internal hackathon as the *real deal*. When my team, the ***Coding Saints***, first attempted SIH in our 3rd year, we cleared the internal hackathon. It gave us hope, but little did we know what was waiting in the next round.

### 2\. Connecting with Organizations: The National Shortlist 🏛️

This is where the **competition gets real**. Once nominated by your college, you’re expected to:

* Submit a **detailed solution** on the SIH portal.
    
* Upload a **presentation** and (optionally) a **YouTube video demo**.
    
* Have your work **evaluated by ministries and industry experts**.
    
* From hundreds of submissions, only **5–6 teams per problem statement** make it to the **grand finale**.
    

**Our first setback:** This is where our SIH 2023 journey ended. We were **rejected** in this round. Our submission lacked clarity, our prototype was half-baked, and we hadn’t given it our 100%. It stung. But looking back, that rejection was the **wake-up call** we desperately needed

### 3\. The Grand Finale: The Craziest 36 Hours ⚡

For the lucky teams that qualify, this is the most thrilling and exhausting part of SIH. The finale is a true test of **skill, stamina, and teamwork**:

* You refine your prototype based on **ministry feedback**.
    
* You work **non-stop for 36 hours** (yes, no proper sleep, just adrenaline + coffee ☕).
    
* You face **multiple judging rounds**, where mentors and evaluators track your progress.
    
* Finally, winners are declared after three nerve-wracking rounds of evaluation.
    

Students who’ve been through it describe it as the **most exhausting yet memorable experience** of their college life. We didn’t reach this stage in our first try. But failing in Stage 2 gave us the clarity and hunger to prepare harder for our comeback attempt in the 4th year which eventually landed us in the finals.

## **How to Approach SIH:**

When students think of hackathons, the first image that comes to mind is coding fast and coding hard. But here’s the truth about **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** preparation is half the battle. In fact, most teams don’t lose because of lack of technical skills. They lose because of poor planning, unclear problem selection, or weak team coordination. If you prepare smartly, you’re already ahead of half the competition. Here’s a practical roadmap you can follow 👇

1. **Forming the Right Team 🤝**
    
    Your team is your biggest strength in SIH. Each team must have **4 to 6** members, with at least one **female** participant. A diverse skill set is crucial. Don’t build a team where everyone is good at the *same* thing. Instead, think in terms of balance.
    
    A sample mix could look like this:
    
    * **1 Frontend Developer**
        
    * **2 AI/ML Developers**
        
    * **1 Data Scientist / Analyst**
        
    * **1 R&D / Documentation**
        
    * **1 Backend & Integration** (that was my role in *Coding Saints* 👨‍💻)
        
    
    Pick teammates who don’t just bring skills but also match your **energy and vibe**. You’ll be working **36+ sleepless hours** together in the finale so trust, coordination, and communication matter way more than raw talent. Also, teams that combine members from **different departments (CSE + ECE + AIDS)** sometimes get an edge during shortlisting, since they can cover wider ground.
    
2. **Selecting the Problem Statement (PS) 🔍**
    
    Choosing the right **Problem Statement (PS)** is half the game won. Here’s the process that worked for us:
    
    * Every team member picked **5 different PS** from the SIH portal.
        
    * For each PS, we wrote a **reason** why it excites us + what possible solution we could build.
        
    * We sat down, discussed, debated all the ideas, and iterated until we reached **unanimous agreement**.
        
    * Finally, we narrowed it down to **3 strong PS options**, each with a clear vision.
        
    
    Don’t pick a PS just because your friend is choosing it or because it’s trending. Choose something aligned with your **skills + passion**. If the PS excites you, you’ll naturally work harder on it.
    
3. **Building the Presentation (Idea Draft)🖼️**
    
    This is the step where **most teams mess up** and it’s the biggest reason they don’t make it to the finals. Remember, your **PPT is your first impression** in front of the ministries and organizations.
    
    Here’s how to nail it:
    
    * **Tell a story**: Keep it simple, clear, and engaging.
        
    * **Visuals &gt; Text**: Slides should explain themselves at a glance.
        
    * **Consistency**: Use a clean, uniform design throughout.
        
    * **Flow**: Problem → Idea → Tech Stack → Feasibility → Impact.
        
    
    **Bonus points**: Add a short **demo video** of your prototype or concept. It massively boosts your chances.  
    In our **first SIH attempt**, our presentation was messy. It was text-heavy, lacked flow, and didn’t show clarity. That was one of the reasons we got rejected in the **organization round**.But in our **second attempt**, we flipped the script. We made our PPT into a **visual story** and that’s what got us shortlisted for the **finals.**
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757845194253/40e66967-394b-4455-b92a-512a7f4e1996.png align="center")

SIH isn’t just about code. It’s about **strategy, clarity, and execution.** If you prepare smartly with the right team, the right PS, and the right presentation, you’ll stand out from 90% of teams who underestimate these steps.

4. **Submission & Patience**
    

Once you’ve built your PPT + optional demo video, you submit it through your college SPOC. After that, it’s a waiting game while ministries evaluate. This is where your **clarity and presentation quality** makes or breaks your chances.

👉 **Want to see how we did it?**  
Here’s the actual **PPT and demo video** we submitted for SIH:

* [***🎥 Our Demo Video on YouTube***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc45tHfFraE)
    

Take a look you’ll notice how we kept the slides **visual, structured, and story-driven.** The video, meanwhile, helped evaluators understand our idea quickly without getting lost in technical jargon.

## Qualifying for SIH Finals

After our first failure, we went back to the drawing board. We rebuilt everything from scratch, gave our second attempt everything we had, and this time, it clicked. When the **shortlist for the finals** was announced, we saw our team’s name on the list.

That feeling? Honestly, incredible. It wasn’t just excitement; it was pure validation. Every late-night discussion, every team restructuring, every heated debate over problem statements it had all finally paid off. I still remember the exact moment: we were in the lab, huddled around a screen, refreshing the portal like maniacs, hearts pounding. And then… there it was. Our name. We screamed, high-fived, and even ran straight to the canteen for a well-deserved **“victory samosa party”** by our own liability member [**Pravin Rajnale**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pravinrajnale/)**.**

But here’s the bigger lesson I want every SIH aspirant to remember:  
👉 **Qualifying for the finals is already a huge achievement.**  
Think about it, out of hundreds of teams in a single college, only 30–35 move forward. Out of thousands across India, only a select few hundred make it to the finale.

### What Lies Ahead ⚡

Qualifying was an incredible milestone, but it was only the beginning. The **SIH finals** are nothing like the internal rounds. They’re not just about having a good idea on paper; they’re about **building, adapting, and surviving a marathon of innovation.**

Imagine this:

* **36+ hours** of non-stop coding, designing, debugging, and pitching.
    
* Real-time feedback from mentors who will **challenge every assumption** you’ve made.
    
* **Three intense evaluation rounds**, where you must win over industry experts and ministry representatives.
    
* Sleepless nights powered by **coffee, Red Bull, and raw determination.**
    

That’s the finale stage. Chaotic, exciting, exhausting and easily one of the **most unforgettable experiences** of a student’s journey. When we entered the finals, we realized just how different the game was. Every team was talented, every idea was polished, and in the end, it came down to **who could adapt and execute under pressure.**

But that’s a story for another day our **finals strategy, survival hacks, and lessons from the 36-hour grind** deserve a chapter of their own. And that’s exactly what I’ll share in **Part 2 of this blog series.**

If you’re here because you’re preparing for **SIH 2025** (or even your very first hackathon), take **Part 1** as your **blueprint for qualification.** And if you’re curious about what really happens once you step into the finals, Stay tuned for **Part 2: The Survival Guide to SIH Finals.**
